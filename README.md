# Automatic-hyperparameter-selection
Here we examine techniques for model selection on classification and regression tasks. In particular, we first explore the effect of model hyperparameters on the bias and variance of the prediction. In the second part we utilize the bias-variance decomposition to perform automatic hyperparameter selection.
